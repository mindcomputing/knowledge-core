/**
 * This class executes the jobs to write to disk, and also has a single thread
 * running to call .get() on the future for each job submitted, to ensure that
 * any errors are logged / warned (if the caller didn't bother to call get)
 *
 * Previous versions of this class used the ExecuterCompletionService stuff...
 * to handle all of this, but that turns out to be fundamentally broken in 
 * combination with JavaFX Task objects - you end up with a Task and a Future, 
 * and the Task never gets completion notification.
 * 
 * The powers that be at Oracle have been perfectly happy to call this terrible
 * behavior a documentation bug....
