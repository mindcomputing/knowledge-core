/**
 * {@link MetaContentService}

 * An interface that allows the storage of information that is not terminology related.
 * Examples include user preferences, but the intent of the API is to be generic.
 * 
 * Implementations of this store do not need to persist data via git changesets, anything stored in this store
 * should be considered to be lost, if a database is rebuilt from the initial data + changesets, until we get a 
 * chance to update this API to allow persistence.

    * Open or create a new data store.  The type of the key and value must be specified.
    * Not being consistent with the Key/Value types for a particular store name will result in

    *
    *  Any object can be utilized for the Key and Value - however, for types outside of the basic types, java serialization will be utilized,
    *  which is quite inefficient.  For storing large objects, it is recommended you make your Value a byte[], and handle the serialization
    *  yourself.
