     *
     * This is really just a convenience wrapper with threading and results conversion on top of the APIs available in {@link DescriptionIndexer}
     *
     * Execute a Query against the description indexes in a background thread, hand back a handle to the search object which will
     * allow you to get the results (when they are ready) and also cancel an in-progress query.
     *
     * If there is a problem with the internal indexes - an error will be logged, and the exception will be re-thrown when the
     * {@link SearchHandle#getResults()} method of the SearchHandle is called.
     *
     * @param searchFunction - A function that will call one of the query(...) methods within an implementation of a {@link IndexQueryService}.
     * @param operationToRunWhenSearchComplete - (optional) Pass the function that you want to have executed when the search is complete and the
     *            results are ready for use. Note that this function will also be executed in the background thread.
     * @param taskId - An optional field that is simply handed back during the callback when results are complete. Useful for matching
     *            requests to this method with callbacks.
     * @param filter - An optional filter than can add or remove items from the tentative result set before it is returned.
     * @param mergeOnConcepts - If true, when multiple semantics attached to the same concept match the search, this will be returned
     *            as a single result representing the concept - with each matching component included, and the score being the best score of any of the
     *            matching items.  When false, you will get one search result per match (per semantic) - so concepts can be returned multiple times.
     * @param manifoldForRead - optional - if not supplied, uses the default for the user / system, for any operations that require getting a
     *            version (as opposed to a chronology).  This primarily impacts convenience methods inside of {@link CompositeSearchResult}
     * @param filterOffPathResults - if true, will only return matching components that are present on the provided stampForVersionRead.  Note,
     * it is faster to do Author / Module / Path restrictions with a {@link AuthorModulePathRestriction} during the query - this should only be used to filter out
     * based on status or time.
     * @return A handle to the running search.
