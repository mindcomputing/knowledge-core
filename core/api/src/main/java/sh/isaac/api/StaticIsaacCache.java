/**
 * Contract for data or service caches that need to be reset when the services
 * are started and stopped on possibly different databases
 * 
 * While this doesn't appear to offer anything over the IsaacCache interface, there is an important distinction.
 * 
 * The LookupService will only call {@link #reset()} on ACTIVATED IsaacCache objects, in order to avoid instantiating
 * things that were never needed.
 * 
 * However, this also means that it won't call {@link #reset()} on caches that utilize a static access method - and
 * the LookupService has no idea if those have been triggered or not. So these services ALWAYS need to have reset called
 * (and their implementations need to be safe to call - aka, no side effects in the constructor that depend on service
 * level activated classes)
 * 
 * This class should be used by any cache object that offers static methods.
 *
